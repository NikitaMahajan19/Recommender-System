FAQ for IP2020 ML Project [22-06-2020 | 20:57]

----------

1. One event element implies the event name.
   Event names are usually strings, as you would know.
   Event names are extracted from communications, so have sentence style names.

2. For each event, an employee's Domain and only one Type (Event1/Event2) should match.
   A type match alone, is considered only for generalised events where no domain is provided.
   A domain match alone, doesn't exist.

3. You are only concerned with the given 183 employees, none else. 
   Do not assume any extra feature outside of the problem statement.

4. If an event doesn't match with any employee, keep its recommendation blank.

5. An example is given here.
